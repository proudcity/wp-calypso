Think you found a bug?
======================
Use the template below to log a new bug. If you want to prefix the title with a “Question:”, “Bug:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful, but by no means mandatory. If you have write access, add the appropriate labels.

Have a feature request?
=======================
If you want to prefix the title with “Question:”, “Feature Request:”, or the general area of the application, that would be helpful. For example, "Editor: add ability to choose from most popular tags" would make a great title.
